# Finance Telegram Bot

This repository contains a simple Telegram bot that records your incomes and expenses in a local CSV file.

## Algorithm Overview

1. **Create a bot in Telegram** using [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and obtain the bot token.
2. **Configure environment variables** for the bot. You can copy `.env.example`
   to `.env` and fill in your values. The bot will automatically load this file
   on startup:
   - `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` â€“ token received from BotFather.
3. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. **Run the bot** using `python bot.py`.
5. Use the `/help` command to see available actions. Commands `/add_income` and
   `/add_expense` accept an amount and description to log transactions.

Transactions are appended to `transactions.csv` in the repository root.
